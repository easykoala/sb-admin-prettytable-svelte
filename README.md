# SB-Admin-PrettyTable-Svelte

A dashboard made by using Svelte and Sapper, inspired from SB-Admin Dashboard.
Add a PrettyTable component, including pagination, search bar, table row operation buttons, etc.

## Getting started

### Clone

    git clone git@github.com:GeekyAnts/sb-admin-svelte.git

### Running the project

However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
cd sb-admin-svelte
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

## Component Library

We have used SvelteStrap as a component library.

### SvelteStrap

SvelteStrap is a UI-Component Library for Svelte. It provides many components which we can use easily, refer to [docs](https://github.com/bestguy/sveltestrap).

## Structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project — `src` and `static`.

### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app — `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` — along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.

#### src/routes

This is the heart of your Sapper app. There are two kinds of routes — _pages_, and _server routes_.

**Pages** are Svelte components written in `.svelte` files. When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel. (Sapper will preload and cache the code for these subsequent pages, so that navigation is instantaneous.)

**Server routes** are modules written in `.js` files, that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods. Each function receives Express `request` and `response` objects as arguments, plus a `next` function. This is useful for creating a JSON API, for example.

There are three simple rules for naming the files that define your routes:

- A file called `src/routes/about.svelte` corresponds to the `/about` route. A file called `src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte` corresponds to the `/blog/:slug` route, in which case `params.slug` is available to the route
- The file `src/routes/index.svelte` (or `src/routes/index.js`) corresponds to the root of your app. `src/routes/about/index.svelte` is treated the same as `src/routes/about.svelte`.
- Files and directories with a leading underscore do _not_ create routes. This allows you to colocate helper modules and components with the routes that depend on them — for example you could have a file called `src/routes/_helpers/datetime.js` and it would _not_ create a `/_helpers/datetime` route

### static

The [static](static) directory contains any static assets that should be available. These are served using [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).

In your [service-worker.js](src/service-worker.js) file, you can import these as `files` from the generated manifest...

```js
import { files } from '@sapper/service-worker';
```

...so that you can cache them (though you can choose not to, for example if you don't want to cache very large files).

## Bundler config

Sapper uses Rollup or webpack to provide code-splitting and dynamic imports, as well as compiling your Svelte components. With webpack, it also provides hot module reloading. As long as you don't do anything daft, you can edit the configuration files to add whatever plugins you'd like.

## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of your app, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy your application to any environment that supports Node 10 or above. As an example, to deploy to [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now) when using `sapper export`, run these commands:

```bash
npm install -g now
now
```

If your app can't be exported to a static site, you can use the [now-sapper](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper) builder. You can find instructions on how to do so in its [README](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper#basic-usage).
